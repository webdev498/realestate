She is, on the other hand, extremely stable and focused with two feet planted firmly on the ground.  Which accounts, in part, for why she was chosen to manage Bellmarc's highly successful West Side office.  Veronica has been with Bellmarc since 1986, having also proven herself as a superior  salesperson.  A manager since 1991, she spends most of her time these days acting as both mentor and teacher. "My door is always open, and people tend to walk in with every type of question imaginable."  Prior to joining Bellmarc, Veronica worked in the fashion industry as a corporate buyer for menswear.  And while she's a graduate of the Fashion Institute of Technology, she admits that "the left side of my brain, the rational side, works best. The only time I'm creative is in a business situation." The right side of her brain does get a lot of use, though, particularly when deals are being done. "I love supporting brokers when they're in the throes of negotiating," she adds. "It's a thrill for me to give someone the creative idea that helped close their deal."  Outside of the office, Veronica is as busy as she is inside.  A hiker, biker and swimmer (all done for pure sport, rather than competitively), she's also a dog lover and adores spending time with her lovable Lab and her rescue dog.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|vraehse@bellmarc.com|cooper01|0||12/31/2007|75.0000000|60.0000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(347)306-4314|0|2.00000000||||(646)783-6640|0||Veronica Raehse|30RA0670919|01/29/2015 03:34:42 PM|34983|VERONICARA|2.00000000|3141E6AB-46C8-4147-8D84-19521B4D6FE3|

Fred is being modest. No one knows the Manhattan market like Fred Taubner. Over the past 23 years, he has learned every aspect of the industry.   Many of his colleagues can be found at his desk asking for advice on difficult deals. Fred has an outgoing personality, combined with a no-nonsense approach in handling negotiations. His clients trust him implicitly, because they know that he will get the job done -- and get it done right.   Fred's track record speaks for itself. In 23 years, he has sold in excess of $250 million of real estate. Even more importantly, if his clients are asked, they will say that after working with Fred, they will never use anyone else again.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|ftaubner@bellmarc.com|ruffian|0||12/31/2007|82.0000000|67.0000000|0|0|0|1.00000000|  /  /    |(917)923-7666|1|2.00000000|||||0||Fred L.

He clearly demonstrates his knowledge, experience and joy in helping people with the important responsibility of a home sale.  With over 19 years experience in real estate sales, Scott knows how to put together a purchase application for potential buyers to help ensure board approval. He keeps current with constantly changing board requirements so as not to waste his sellers' time with buyers who don't meet their boards' criteria. His marketing experience and up-to-date knowledge of market values help sellers get top dollar for their homes.   Scott is similarly successful with helping buyers find homes that are right for them. He attributes this to his ability to read people. Body language and speech nuances reveal preferences of which Scott's clients are not even aware.    "Many of my customers haven't been through this process before ... but I have, numerous times, successfully, so I know how to guide them. Some are astounded at my ability to find the home that suits them, but it's a combination of experience and really caring," says Scott. "This is not 'just' a sale, it's an important interaction for people -- and for me."

She is fully bilingual and bicultural, and also speaks Spanish. Before selling coops and condos, Suzel had a successful 15-year career as a sales representative for a wholesale paper merchant. She was one of the very first and very few women in the field.  What Suzel loves about selling real estate is that it allows her to use both her skill with numbers and her fine sense of aesthetics. She knows a good investment from a poor one. Not only does she help clients figure out what they can afford and will be a good investment , but, with her keen eye, she can help them see how to make the best use of their space. Above all, though, it is her ability to truly listen to her clients and put their needs first that makes her such a pleasure to work with.  Suzel brings to the real estate industry a rare mix of tenacity, diplomacy and patience. She always remembers that friendliness counts, and helps her buyers and sellers get what they want in a relaxed, stress-free way. She is a true believer in the "win-win" principle. Suzel wants everyone to leave the closing with smiles on their faces ... and she will work hard to make that happen.|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|sstampleman@bellmarc.com|piegea|0||12/31/2007|65.0000000|50.0000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    ||1|4.00000000|||||0||Suzel F.

Svetlana was extremely proactive, getting our home featured on the New York Times 'On the Market' page and hosting several open houses that facilitated the quick sale of the apartment at a fine price. Bellmarc's open house full page ad listings were wonderful in bringing in many potential buyers. The professionalism, attention, and thoroughness that Svetlana gave us was superb!" - Susan & David  "Thank you, Svetlana, for helping me every step of the way - from narrowing the search for the perfect apartment to guiding me through the intricacies of bidding and finalizing the contract. You came to anticipate what I was looking for and were invaluable in helping me obtain it. I will highly recommend you every chance I get." - Robyn  "I would highly recommend Svetlana to sell any apartment. She worked with me to determine the best strategy to highlight my apartment's best features. She also looked beyond the apartment itself, highlighting the building and the neighborhood -- Svetlana can see the whole package and knows how to position to the right customers. Svetlana has a good balance of being aggressive while keeping expectations in check. My apartment sold in a matter of weeks during the summer, and this was due to Svetlana's deep understanding of the market, good judgment and taste." - Arden  "We would recommend Svetlana Choi without reservation to friends and prospective buyers. She understood our needs; she persevered and looked very hard for us to find that perfect fit. When we found our apartment she tenaciously tracked us through a very complex board approval situation. She held our hands and helped us maneuver through the lengthy three-month board approval process and was always available to us." - Susan & Thomas  "On a very tight budget and with particular space needs, Svetlana meticulously and methodically searched the city for appropriate apartments.

"Ann's approach was so refreshingly laid-back, that I forgot  she even had a financial interest in my apartment hunt and I think  that she forgot too," laughs one client. "She's the anti-agent," says another customer.   She will point out negatives and always wants to feel confident that the buyer and seller are happy with their decision.  A longtime Manhattan resident, Ann grew up in rural New Jersey on a farm. She moved to the city because she loved the idea of having more people around. Paris was a thought, but her limited French didn't bode well for an extended stay.  She graduated from Columbia University where she majored in art history and psychology. Unable to decide among her passions, Ann went back to Columbia for graduate work in psychology. Once again there was conflict, so she got a certificate in Interior Design from Parsons.   And there was always her interest in ceramics. She currently reviews and writes about contemporary ceramics for two art magazines. After stints as a teacher ("too noisy"), HR executive ("too many cubicles") and museum research work ("too dusty"), Ann found that a career in real estate was just right.   Working with both buyers and sellers, she is able to blend her eclectic interests and skills. Real estate was an unplanned serendipitous choice and it has been a long run and a hit.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|arothman@bellmarc.com|123580|1||12/31/2007|50.0000000|50.0000000|0|1|1|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)544-4724|0|4.00000000|||||0||Ann C.

His diverse background, which includes financial management posts with major international entertainment firms, has helped Charlie represent his clients with not only sensitivity to their needs and goals, but also a well-honed business acumen crucial in helping them negotiate the best deal possible   Through both his personal experience as a buyer and seller and his professional experience managing an array of real estate transactions for clients, Charlie thoroughly understands the needs of buyers and sellers, both first-timers and veterans alike, and knows how to close deals for them.  Charlie earned his undergraduate degree from the University of Virginia and an MBA in International Business and Finance from New York University, which included a stint at an Austrian business school.   Testimonial:  When we had a family crisis, we had to sell an apartment in NYC. Time was very critical, my uncle was very ill and we had to move quickly.  We chose Charlie due to his association with the building, the positive feedback from the neighbors, and his history of selling other condos in the building. Charlie helped me with all the contacts for painters, cleaning lady, floor refinishing company, condo association, attorney, etc. At no time did I feel lost in this process. Charlie always kept us informed. When we had a bid more than our asking price, Charlie confirmed the buyer's funds and verified everything.  He worked nights and weekends and sold it in record time. Charlie went beyond what we expected.  We were very lucky to find and have him as our agent. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking to sell or buy NYC. His experience and contacts were perfect every time. My uncle would tell Charlie "show me the money" and I would laugh. In the end, Charlie did.                                              -- Veronica Bucher-Morelli and Bob Bucher, Florida|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|csummers@bellmarc.com|cs00su|0||12/31/2007|75.0000000|65.0000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)376-1648|1|4.00000000|||||0||Charles C.

To her, selling is about understanding people.  "I start by getting a sense of who the client is and what they want.  Only when I have a clear picture of what will make them happy do we look at apartments."  Lena makes it look easy, but her "instincts" have been honed by decades of sales and marketing experience in high-end fashion and real estate.  One quality you can always count on with Lena is integrity.  She cares about her clients' best interests, and understands that this business is based on long-term relationships.  Bellmarc chose Lena as one of the brokers entrusted to sell and rent apartments that it owns on its own behalf.    Having grown up as an Indian in Singapore with family in Hong Kong, Lena is fluent in Malaysian and speaks some Mandarin and Cantonese.  However, New York City, her home of over 20 years and the place where she and her husband are raising their two children, continues to enchant her.  With her warm, engaging, upbeat style, Lena will make buying or selling your home a fun, relaxed experience.    Testimonials:  Thank you very much for helping us get this apartment. I am very pleased with your services and the professionalism. I am sure we will be doing more business together whenever the opportunity presents itself.  Best regards Ashok  It was a real pleasure working with you.  We love love our apartment- thank you very much for all your wonderful help and guidance.  Please stop by whenever you are in our area.

A family member, a friend, or business associate was always either buying or selling an apartment or townhouse.  She remembers when a cousin bought a townhouse on East Seventy Second Street for $26,000 . There were some who thought she overpaid.  Today, as a broker, Sue herself can speak knowledgably both about particular neighborhoods and general market trends.  Sue has extensive  experience in finance.  She spent several years as a pension consultant with the United Federation of Teachers.  This experience of talking to people about their money is of great value to buyers who are not sure how much they can really afford or ought to spend on an apartment.  She is also expert at valuing apartments, and really knows what price will close a deal.  Sue prides herself on the excellent personalized service that she provides for all her clients.  She knows being available at all times to both buyers and sellers is the key to successfully completed transactions.  Buying or selling an apartment is a stressful experience.  Her  job is to make it as simple and profitable as possible.  Hobbies?  She plays competitive bridge, tennis, and does yoga.  But of course, her real passion is helping people to either find the perfect home for themselves, or  to get the best price when they sell theirs.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|sscott@bellmarc.com|4209so|0||12/31/2007|55.0000000|55.0000000|0|0|0|1.00000000|  /  /    |(917)671-7897|1|4.00000000|(212)758-7495||||0||Susan Orbach|30OR1008072|09/29/2015 04:23:42 PM|37781|SUSANORBAC|2.00000000|03155C34-B8CA-40A8-B172-53EAC29E3481|

As soon as she arrived in the Big Apple she  eagerly pursued her interests in music, writing, yoga and hiking, developing many new friendships along the way.  Even with that busy schedule, she  found time for volunteer work, teaching English as a second language to new immigrants in New York and working for several months after 9/11 in the disaster centers to help survivors secure assistance.   Leonora's ultimate commitment to Manhattan was made when she bought a home and investment property here, a decision that makes her well-suited to advise clients about the complexities of buying and selling real estate.

Meeting deadlines in fashion is the norm, so Marcia learned early on that missing one could prove expensive. Today, her clients never have to worry that something will be overlooked at a closing.    One of the keys to Marcia's success in real estate is that she gives everyone the time and attention they deserve.    "I have no desire to serve ten clients at once," she explains. "When I'm working with someone I make sure I'm available for them all the time."    As an added bonus, aided by her degree from the Fashion Institute of Technology, Marcia has a flair for pulling together a pleasing home design scheme and envisioning a successful renovation.  An avid traveler, Marcia says her favorite place in the world -- outside of New York -- is Tuscany. She also likes to cook and counts rack of lamb and lamb shank among her specialties.  Marcia is also involved in community service.

Her vacations are adventurous rather than restful: a photo safari in South Africa and hiking in Turkey are memorable trips -- mainland China is next on her list of places to go. Her love of travel has yielded a unique body of experiences: she has petted tigers in the temples of Thailand, ridden elephants through a labyrinth of mountain trails and has sat mere feet away from lion cubs at play.  An Upper East Side resident, Niki enjoyed a successful career as an attorney until concluding that her energy level was too high for the staid and structured world of corporate law. An experienced negotiator, she carefully engineered a seamless exit strategy that allowed a major career change: entrepreneurialism. Each of the skills that made her an accomplished lawyer -- negotiation, resourcefulness, concise and clear client communication  -- has helped make her a success as a real estate agent.

Enthusiastic. Expert. These are some of the words clients and friends use to describe Gina Kuhlenkamp.    A financial industry veteran servicing high net worth clients at top global financial services firms in New York and San Francisco, Gina feels most accomplished when helping buyers and sellers achieve their home sales goals in New York City.    "Real estate is a dynamic and challenging, fast paced environment," said Gina, who has helped clients locate and sell townhouses, condominiums and coops across Manhattan. "I love working with people and staying on top of events that affect the market."    Gina works with buyers and sellers across the city: over the years she has become a neighborhood and building specialist in East Midtown, where she first rented a loft, before purchasing at Turtle Bay Towers, 310 East 46th Street. She has since become an Upper East Side expert, in the latest neighborhood she calls home.   Having succeeded at two of the toughest industries, Gina prides herself on not taking "no" for an answer, while maintaining her sunny, vivacious and passionate nature. Clients choose Gina as she listens, thinks far in advance of the "now" in her clients' lives, is always prepared and doesn't give up or give in.   While Gina loves all that is NYC - Central Park with her Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, sunsets over the Hudson and sunrise on the East River, the promenade by bicycle and her Upper East Side gym branch - she also adores traveling in Europe, cooking, wine, museums and libraries.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|gkuhlenkamp@bellmarc.com|hepburn|0||12/31/2007|75.0000000|60.0000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)929-9929|0|4.00000000|||||0||Gina M.

For Fred, one key to staying cool and professional in the fast-paced and often pressured world of real estate sales is keeping his sense of humor.   When it comes to selling a home, Fred's keen business sense, creative eye and marketing finesse will expedite the sale and make it easy for the seller.  "Fred handled the sale of our apartment seamlessly," explained one seller.  "He is a consummate professional, with great humor, and offers valuable guidance. We have recommended Fred to several people, and would work with him again in a heartbeat."  A native New Yorker, Fred owns investment properties in the city, and was vice president of his co-op board for 11 years, so he's very familiar with the complexities of the market.  And since he has raised his two boys in Manhattan, Fred is a terrific resource when it comes to answering questions about the city's public and private schools.  "The process of purchasing an apartment in NYC can be quite stressful," explained one buyer. "Fred put us at ease, and educated us on the whole process.  We had a very tight budget, and Fred helped us find the very best property for our money. We couldn't have been more satisfied."   Today you'll often find him in Gramercy's neighborhood parks (he is the President of the local dog run) with his energetic golden retriever, Baxter.  To find out just how his commitment and over a decade of experience will help you, kindly give Fred a call.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|fslavin@bellmarc.com|capecod|0||12/31/2007|70.0000000|70.0000000|0|1|1|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)945-0572|1|2.00000000|||||0|fredslavin1@gmail.com|Fred Slavin|30SL1039042|04/27/2015 03:44:35 PM|38026|FREDSLAVIN|2.00000000|F4CE5B3D-0422-4BD5-96CE-ACC14759D830|

Andia joined Bellmarc and the New York real estate industry after a career in advertising. She spent most of her career in account management, coordinating the different professionals who put together an ad campaign and acting as an intermediary between them and the client. She was directly responsible for keeping complex projects moving forward and ensuring that the end result reflected the client's needs. Her resourcefulness and creativity in problem solving were crucial in achieving the desired final product, in the targeted time frame and budget range.   Andia later worked as a Vice President of Client Services for a research company that compiles and analyzes data used in the advertising industry. She had to understand her clients' goals in order to provide them with the appropriate market research and analysis.   "I was dedicated to serving my clients by listening to what they wanted and providing them with what they truly needed to meet their goals," Andia says. She applies that same dedication and acute understanding to meeting the needs of her real estate clients.   Andia is a native New Yorker who has served on the board of her co-op. Having combined three apartments into one, she knows the intricacies of dealing with co-op boards and what can be accomplished by approaching problems with a little ingenuity and determination.   Determination is one of Andia's hallmarks and has helped her finish six marathons (five in NYC). Just as in real estate sales, running a marathon is about "putting one foot in front of the other until you get to the finish line," she says.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|asmull@bellmarc.com||0||12/31/2007|.000000000|.000000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)575-7232|1|4.00000000|||||0||Andia R.

After working in different capacities in the NYC educational system, from education evaluator to diagnostic clinician to case manager on a special education support team to teacher -- specializing in working with children and young adults who had learning difficulties, as well as with their parents and other support personnel -- Judy became increasingly drawn to the excitement of real estate. When working with children, she made sure each child had a rewarding and successful experience so they could develop confidence and move on. Now, she brings that same desire to enact rewarding experiences to her clients, who benefit from her encouragement, persistence and support.  "I like to make it a rewarding experience for my clients, not only in terms of getting a home they love, but also making the task of buying or selling as positive and pleasant an experience as possible ... and making the client feel and know that I am working in their best interests in an honest and trusting manner," says Judy.  A native New Yorker (born in Brooklyn), Judy enjoys much of what New York City offers, including attending the opera and ballet, working out at the gym, swimming, walking and gardening.

Her mother's obsession not only necessitated half a dozen moves for Susan before the age of 18 - but set the stage for a similar vagabond existence for her as an adult.   In addition to an innate knack for buying and selling real estate, Susan has a genuine appreciation for its architecture and history - especially pre-war - having restored a Civil War colonial on Long Island's North Fork.  With an undeniable understanding of both the emotional and practical elements of home buying and ownership, Susan brings to her clients an instant rapport and unique perspective as a Bellmarc agent. Her keen understanding of her customer's hopes and desires, combined with an in-depth knowledge of Manhattan's diverse neighborhoods, enables her to work intimately with each buyer to find the home of their dreams.   Susan joined the real estate industry after a successful career in the field of public relations. A native New Yorker, she has called Manhattan's Upper West Side home for the past 20 years and currently resides on her favorite avenue - Riverside Drive.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|sblankman@bellmarc.com|tigerlynn|0||12/31/2007|50.0000000|50.0000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    ||0|4.00000000|||||0||Susan Blankman|40BL1109732|08/24/2015 12:10:12 PM|43446|SUSANBLANK|1.00000000||

Her clients appreciate her energy, enthusiasm, humor and straightforward communication style -- as well as her knowledge of Manhattan's diverse neighborhoods, transportation, culture, shopping, dining and nightlife possibilities.  For sellers, Christine blends the seller's priorities with her expert counsel.  After a seller took Christine's recommendations - which yielded multiple offers - he commented that he was glad he accepted her suggestions and knew it would be wise to continue to do so!  For buyers, a midtown dentist summed it up best when she said, "Christine took away all the fears of buying my first place. She was knowledgeable and walked me through the process. She listened to what I needed for myself and worked tirelessly to search for the perfect place. She also acted as a great referral source, suggesting trustworthy real estate attorneys and mortgage brokers I needed to close the deal. A great experience!"  A born-and-raised New Yorker, Christine grew up in the Financial District and is the product of the NYC public schools system. She attended Hunter College High School on the Upper East Side and only left New York City briefly for Vassar College, where she earned a bachelor's degree in Mathematics. Christine and her husband reside in their coop apartment.  According to Christine, "Owning a home is so rewarding.  It is such a good feeling to build equity and not contribute to someone else's wealth by paying rent."   In her spare time Christine volunteers with Big Brothers Big Sisters and New York Cares. She also stays in shape by playing soccer with Zogsports, rock climbing at Chelsea Piers and jogging on the Brooklyn Bridge.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|cchin@bellmarc.com|ponster|0||12/31/2007|50.0000000|50.0000000|0|0|0|2.00000000|03/10/2016|(646)342-9197|1|4.00000000|||||0||Christine Chin|10301210579|03/10/2016 12:48:54 PM|44216|CHRISTINEP|2.00000000|DFA6429D-D6E8-4152-959B-8607198BC2C3|

A coop owner for the past 17 years, Kathy "lives" the advantages of home ownership in Manhattan. Buyers and sellers alike benefit from her insights as a coop board member (Vice President for 8 years, and Board Treasurer for the last 7). When it comes to putting together an impressive board package, preparing for the board interview, or finding a qualified buyer, clients are happy to have Kathy on their side.  "When a new West Side apartment in our price range came onto the market, Kathy had a hunch it might perfectly suit our needs - and she was right," one buyer recalls.  "Kathy helped make the whole process of finding and buying an apartment smooth and congenial."  Customers find that Kathy is as comfortable with "the numbers" of making a real estate deal as she is helping clients with the "softer" side of home ownership. No surprise, actually. She has lived and worked in Hong Kong, Singapore and Italy -- and holds a B.A. in Education from Rutgers University, and a M.Ed. in Mathematics and Music from West Chester College in Pennsylvania.  "Kathy was fantastic to work with.  She was very professional and proactive in getting my co-op sold in short order," explains one seller. "Kathy's knowledge of the market and the real estate business is impressive.  You couldn't ask for a better agent.  I truly feel lucky to have found her."  An avid supporter of the Humane Society of New York, Kathy shares her Murray Hill brownstone with her two adopted tuxedo cats, Weebie Louise and Marian.  Kathy and her fellow Bellmarc broker Fred Slavin work together as a team to get the best possible results for each of their clients. They point out that, with their team approach, "You get our 36 years of sales and marketing experience, our in-depth knowledge of Manhattan's unique and diverse neighborhoods -- along with truly round-the-clock availability."

Alice knows that New Yorkers are constantly busy and in motion, making the time and occasional stresses involved in a home sale difficult to add into a packed lifestyle.   She works to accommodate the living needs of her clients and their families ... whether that be work, school, recreation and activities, or other commitments. With Alice there are no "work hours." Her availability is dictated in accordance with her client's schedule so that together, the right deal is made at the right time.  Alice strives to satisfy her clients' needs and desires to the utmost, a level of service that turns new buyers and sellers into "clients for life."   "Finding the right home goes beyond the walls of the property. I like to understand my client's overall lifestyle: From family structure to leisure activities, a person's lifestyle is critical when trying to find the right home for a prospect," says Alice. "I want to make sure that the surroundings outside the dwelling are just as fulfilling as the layout inside."  Alice joined the New York real estate industry after careers as a hair stylist and a finance manager for Sun Holidays, a tour operator serving travelers to Europe and Central and South America, and as a real estate agent in Florida.  Born and raised in the Dominican Republic, Alice moved to New York at 18 and has spent most of her adult life here, specifically in Murray Hill, apart from spells in Connecticut and Orlando.   Fluent in Spanish and aided by her international travel experience, Alice understands the nuances of different cultures, enabling her to ably serve clients from all parts of the world.

As a long-time resident of Manhattan, Francine keeps abreast of market trends and is a pro at predicting which "less-traveled" neighborhoods are poised for expansion.   Creative by nature, Francine has used a variety of approaches to attract loyal clients and exciting listings throughout the city. With a warm, winning smile and a fabulous sense of humor in even the most stressful situations, Francine charms her clients by recognizing their needs almost instantly. Francine considers herself to be a "matchmaker" of sorts, and has a special knack for introducing clients to their "dream" properties.  While studying at Baruch College, Francine made critical relationships that allowed her to acquire income-generating properties - she immediately became hooked on the business! She is an expert negotiator and is always thrilled to take on a new challenge.   Recently, Francine bought the "eyesore" of a small Fire Island community despite local naysayers. Inspired by her vision of the perfect beach getaway, Francine wasted no time _ she overhauled the property within 60 days, just in time for Memorial Day. The property was later featured in "Newsweek," only reaffirming her fascination with real estate.   Having bought and sold her own noteworthy properties, Francine has the indispensable quality of being able to identify with people on all sides of the business.  Testimonials  "We are profoundly grateful for your help in selling our apartment at 233 East 70th Street. We chose you to list our apartment over other brokers because of your friendly personality, professional reputation, sensible staging ideas (you did not suggest major repairs or ask us to empty our apartment) and pragmatic pricing strategy. Your hard work and help in creatively photographing and marketing our apartment (including adding additional traffic by coordinating simultaneous open houses) amazingly led to an acceptable offer within two months! We are very pleased with the process and outcome and we would unhesitatingly recommend you to anyone in the building and local area." -- Steve Broer and Colleen Morrissey   "I wanted to give you an acknowledgement for all the extra effort you put into this deal. You went way above and beyond what the average broker would have done to insure that the deal closed - especially all the extra paperwork, preparing the HUD, etc. So, thank you!" -- Mark Dana, Wells Fargo  "I know (there was) a lot more work than any of us anticipated. Really, I don't think anyone else could have done a better job! You are the perfect mediator, and I'm sure your candor and frankness helped to motivate these people (to close the deal).  -- Annette F., Seller  "We were really glad to have you representing us during this sale.

Shifting gears between the performing arts, motherhood, and real estate, Nadine has remained focused and dedicated to each career she has pursued. Nadine's ability to multitask and prioritize makes the juggling of a deal's demands appear easy.  Born in Israel and raised in Sri Lanka and Liberia, Nadine has been exposed to an array of cultures and languages.

Lynda's sense of humor and direct, ethical manner appeal to clients seeking a sales agent who is focused, professional - and yet still caring and compassionate. Her clients' biggest advocate, she would never suggest they settle for a deal that she wouldn't agree to herself. Her sellers are confident in her ability to secure the best price for their properties, and her buyers are always amazed at Lynda's talent for honing into their individual styles, tastes and visions.   While growing up in New Jersey and Virginia, Lynda assimilated her family's theory that real estate ownership could be leveraged for future financial investments. Keeping a close watch on market trends, Lynda used this theory to unlock opportunities for herself: She has strategically bought and sold properties in Virginia, Florida, and New York City. She is certain that her familiarity with Manhattan and knack for "striking while the iron is hot" allow her to offer clients expert and relevant market guidance.  Lynda prides herself on having the intuition needed to sense and understand people's needs - intuition strengthened through her undergraduate work in psychology and master's studies in social work, as well as post-grad training in psychoanalytic studies.

The enormous upside of that transaction, along with her fascination with this city and her desire to help others achieve the same dream, lured Lisa into the real estate business.   Lisa, a native Californian, has been a Manhattan resident since graduating from U.C. Berkeley with a B.A. in English. She works with clients in Manhattan and Brooklyn, and has a particularly deep knowledge of the Manhattan neighborhoods in which she's lived, including the Village, Soho/Tribeca, Chelsea, Lincoln Center and the Upper West Side.   A writer and editor for twenty years, Lisa successfully worked with magazine, newspaper and public relations professionals with the most exacting standards and expectations. Her first jobs at Vanity Fair and Vogue put her in touch with some of best and the brightest in the world, requiring her to deal diplomatically and effectively with CEOs, heads of state, philanthropists, entrepreneurs and politicians, as well as fashion, design and arts and entertainment icons. Her subsequent work for NYC luxury lifestyle publications familiarized her with Manhattan's high-end real estate market. As a public relations writer, she created unique marketing materials for such cutting edge, culture-driven companies as Oililly and Kidrobot  In 2004, she received an MFA in Creative Writing from Columbia University's School of the Arts. Her head for business, combined with a sensitivity for the unique needs of artists, musicians and others in creative fields, has drawn those clients to her real estate services and expertise.  Lisa creates compelling materials for sellers, showcasing properties to their best advantage, as well as translating the desires and parameters of buyers into a real property for a fair price. Both buyers and sellers benefit from her market savvy; top-notch organization, communications and research skills; and innate ability to deal with complex logistics and financial scenarios and to anticipate and satisfy the needs of each individual client.   Her clients also appreciate her gentle, yet effective, powers of persuasion and a finely-honed talent for negotiation and consensus building, as well as her professionalism, intelligence, integrity, low-key style, empathy, attention to detail, sense of humor and ability to keep a cool head under pressure.  Lisa still lives in that great coop she bought -- and renovated -- on the Upper West Side, with her Siberian Husky, Aggie.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|lgarey@bellmarc.com|aggie235|0||12/31/2007|77.0000000|62.0000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)445-5803|1|4.00000000|||||0||Lisa R.

Her conscientiousness, hard work, insightfulness and sense of humor have won her many loyal clients.  A New Yorker for most of her life, Diane has moved between the Upper East Side, Murray Hill and the Village, spent several years in Paris, and finally scouted and signed off on the deal for her own apartment on Riverside Drive.

An ardent film and theatergoer, Diane also enjoys listening to music and writing.    Testimonials:  "Diane cares about people's dreams, needs and fiscal integrity from every angle.

Tenacious and loyal, Nanette brings her sellers rapid and unparalleled offers, as she negotiates adeptly to get her buyers the best possible deals.

In short, she gets things done by giving her all to make the match between buyer and seller happen.

Prior to entering real estate, Nanette worked in marketing and advertising, where she developed the skills that make her an ace at marketing her listings. She received a Ph.D. from the City University of New York Graduate Center, and completed the first year of an MBA at NYU's Stern School of Business.

He is friendly and passionate about helping his clients find and sell homes, and possesses a clear and effective communication and negotiation style.  Robert turned to real estate sales after selling his own coop. He learned that what sellers save in commission is lost in time, aggravation and a lower sales price. And as a buyer, he searched nearly a year for a home and suffered through bidding wars and a board rejection. These experiences made him value the service sales agents provide and gave him the determination to help buyers and sellers avoid similar agonies, while experiencing the thrill of closing the right deal.  In addition to Business and Communications studies, Robert's academic experiences include studying French at an international university in Paris.

Her strong integrity and sincere interest in her customers' best interests combine with her seasoned knowledge to instill an invaluable sense of trust and confidence, which are vital elements throughout any transaction.   Christine attributes her success to her diligence and dedication.  Put simply, she is honest, experienced, and adept at listening to and acting on people's individual needs.  "The reason I love this business is that I truly enjoy walking someone through the most important purchase they can make - their home.  I feel I can really make a difference in their lives, and I take that responsibility very seriously."   A residential specialist since 1996, Christine previously worked on Wall Street and in the retail industry, with her focus always on sales and customer interaction.  She was born and raised in New York City, and attended New York University on an academic scholarship where she studied Marketing and Management.   Christine herself is a longtime investor and a serious follower of the stock market.  As such, she is always on the pulse of both the real estate and financial markets.  When not hard at work, she enjoys reading, shopping, the theater and dining out.   Dear Mr. Berman:  We are writing this letter to you to express our appreciation for the guidance and skill that Christine Kazanecki exhibited when working with us on the purchase of a condominium for our son Adam.    We gave Christine our wish list in terms of location (Upper East Side), type of building and condition. She immediately went to work and showed us some viable alternatives. What impressed us is that she listened to our needs and has a keen sense of certain buildings and the neighborhoods.   We settled on one apartment and even put in an offer since it was very large relative to other apartments but we were not completed convinced about the building or location on York Avenue. Sensing this, she continued to search the listings and told us about a new listing that had just hit the market and she though that we should see it. We did and loved everything about it and so did our son. If it weren't for her tenacity and quick thinking we might have settled for something we didn't love, or not have purchased anything at all. Her guidance and professionalism continued through the board application to closing.   We are now proud and happy owners of a home at 350 East 82nd Street. Christine accomplished all she promised and more. Her overall performance was outstanding. There are numerous brokers out there and we definitely hit on the right one. She is an asset to your firm. We certainly will turn to her again when we are looking to purchase a pied a terre or investment property for ourselves in the not too distant future.   Sincerely, Sharon and Moshe|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|ckazanecki@bellmarc.com|mom327mom|0||  /  /    |50.0000000|50.0000000|1|1|1|1.00000000|  /  /    ||1|4.00000000|||||0||Christine D.

He is determined and focused yet easy going, relentless in the pursuit of the deal yet relaxed and personable, serious yet imbued with a unique East Village sensibility and unconventional sense of humor. All these traits add up to a smart, nimble, steady guide through sales and negotiating. In fact, he was once dubbed by an ad-hoc group of Boston University law students as "the reasonable man."   Justin is always eager to go the distance on behalf of sellers, persistently and creatively marketing their properties to attract the best suited, most qualified buyers.  He enjoys helping inexperienced buyers with their new adventure -- to understand the market and the buying process, and imagining and realizing their best home possible. With experienced buyers, he enjoys sharing and serving their particular, sophisticated vision.   Justin's clients appreciate that he listens to them and "gets" them. He asks good questions -- not only to understand, but in doing so, his clients and customers fully consider their options and learn about what's most important to them.   Before entering real estate, Justin worked in New York film production for 30 years, the last 15 of which were spent as a Location Manager helping directors fulfill their nuanced requests for the perfect filming environments. He made agreements with a full spectrum of property owners, meeting their needs as well.   A 30-year resident of the East Village, Justin enjoys photography, gardening, sailing, and both the beach and the mountains. He graduated with a B.S. degree in Broadcast Journalism from the Newhouse School of Public Communications, Syracuse University. He believes training for the occasional marathon provides him the stamina and a perspective his clients deserve.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|jcooke@bellmarc.com|caut10us|0||  /  /    |.000000000|.000000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(646)279-5508|0|4.00000000||||(646)279-5508|0||Justin Cooke|10401223854|01/29/2015 03:34:43 PM|54634|JUSTINCOOK|1.00000000||

The key to Ruth's success is value - whether talking about properties or in regard to her service. As she says, "I am a people-person who was raised knowing one statement - 'The Customer is Always Right.'"  In this technology-driven age, interpersonal relationships often suffer.  Ruth works to raise the bar. She treats people with honesty and respect.  To her, each and every property, no matter the price, is equally important.  Ruth believes that after all, when you own a property, that property is special to you.  According to Ruth, one the biggest pleasures she derives from real estate is sitting at a closing and seeing "big grins" across the room. To her, a good deal is one where all parties are happy. One of her favorite expressions is "One should make a customer not a sale." She wants people to say about her that she listened to them, worked non-stop for them, that they truly mattered to her and that she got them the best deal possible.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|rgoldsmith@bellmarc.com|ruth9268|0||  /  /    |55.0000000|55.0000000|1|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)312-2054|0|4.00000000|||||0||Ruth Diane Goldsmith Russo|10301205672|01/29/2015 03:34:43 PM|57534|RUTHGOLDSM|2.00000000|CC803E4D-359B-4599-A500-8537C8ECB674|

A dedicated business professional, she has a good old-fashioned work ethic combined with a contemporary sensibility of modern society and technology. She is a great communicator because she knows how to listen.  Beatrice believes that clients are smart and informed, and that it is her job to make buying or selling a home as simple and as painless as possible. She is honest and straightforward, seeking to build long-term relationships and helping people achieve their goals rather than just closing a deal. Beatrice also has an attention to detail and a desire to see a project through from start to finish. Her knowledge of the market is invaluable and her stint as Treasurer on the board of her former Condo has given her great familiarity with how boards and property management companies operate.  Prior to entering real estate, she spent almost 15 years working in the Finance industry. For most of that time Beatrice was an Equities analyst, helping make decisions for investing clients' money in foreign stock markets. She also did institutional equities sales, selling investment ideas to portfolio managers, where she was able to combine her analytical thinking with her love of working with people.   Beatrice is as much of a number-cruncher as she is a "people person," which allows her to understand a client's needs from both a personal and a financial perspective. She has a BA from New York University, with a major in Economics and a minor in Spanish. She also has an MBA from New York University, with a double major in Finance and Management.    A world traveler, she has a great appreciation for different cultures and backgrounds. While English is Beatrice's native tongue, she speaks Russian fluently and is proficient in Spanish.  Currently a resident of midtown Manhattan, Beatrice shares her life with her cockapoo, who helps her live her life with joy.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|bbarenboim@bellmarc.com|hannah1999|0||  /  /    |.000000000|.000000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)442-0402|1|4.00000000|||||0|bbarenboim@gmail.com|Beatrice Barenboim|10401240275|01/29/2015 03:34:43 PM|59522|BEATRICEBA|1.00000000|314029F6-2B7C-44F9-BADB-036634941FA5|

She is a guide and teacher, as needed, and is the perfect partner to help her clients achieve their real estate goals.  Carol has been involved in the running of her building and is aware of the challenges and choices that buildings have to make to balance finances, efficiency and appearance. From work and personal experience, she knows that patience and persistence are the calling cards to successful transactions. There is a delicate balance between being flexible enough to find productive solutions while never loosing focus of the client's needs.  Her buyers know that she will never give up until they have found an apartment that they're comfortable with. Finding the right place can take time, and patience is required to travel the twists and turns of the journey. Carol knows that it's very important to let clients go through this process no matter how circuitous or exhausting it may be. She is by nature inquisitive and has great research skills. She can convey to buyers her market knowledge with the assurance that she's on their side so they can make an educated choice. As a realist, Carol honestly presents issues that may present problems down the line rather than ignoring them, and is determined to find solutions to any impediment.  Sellers find Carol's persistence and tenacity work toward marketing their apartments in the best possible light. In addition, because of her design background, she can suggest ways to present apartments to their best advantage.  Carol is a licensed architect who, after working many years in architecture, started working with private developers and then New York State to develop land and sell of state-owned properties. She is a writer and has published two books-Hotel Bars and Lobbies and Redeveloping Industrial Sites. She also writes about design and urban issues for magazines and websites. Carol received a Master's degree in Architecture from Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation and has a B.A. from Columbia's School of General Studies.  Carol was drawn to real estate because, as she says, real estate is the life-blood of New York -the core of what people are talking about. A native of the New York City area, she has spent her life in Manhattan, with the exception of several years in Paris and Los Angeles.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|cberens@bellmarc.com|manhat1000|0||  /  /    |.000000000|.000000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)597-3354|1|4.00000000|||||0||Carol Berens|10401239152|01/29/2015 03:34:43 PM|59396|CAROLBEREN|1.00000000|35B93E14-B200-47A6-9A4A-B71DCC64F6E6|

During her successful career real estate, she has sold everything from a West Side studio to a multi-million dollar Park Avenue penthouse.  Her obvious knowledge of the city is topped by what she says is "a deep understanding of what the New York City client really wants and needs."

Nancy has helped her grown daughters find and decorate their homes.  With vast personal and professional experience dealing with people and their families, she knows she can inspire most clients to achieve their real estate "dream," and most clients can inspire her to do her very best.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|nnelson@bellmarc.com|4848val|0||  /  /    |.000000000|.000000000|1|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)705-0224|1|4.00000000|||||0|val44@nyc.rr.com|Nancy Nelson|40NE0860426|12/02/2015 09:33:51 AM|60017|NANCYNELSO|1.00000000|B8178A93-5721-49BB-BB7E-73A5A1D98C23|

Kevin works throughout Manhattan to find not only the best value possible, but also the ideal home for your unique lifestyle.   Whether you are renting or buying, he works with you every step of the way so you are educated, and until you are fully satisfied. "I'm not happy until you are happy," is Kevin's motto_and he is extremely focused on that end result.   A condo and investment property owner himself, Kevin understands real estate from both emotional and financial perspectives. Originally from Northern New Jersey, he holds a BA degree in Communications from Villanova University. What he loves most about New York City is that no matter what it is you're looking for, you can find it. "The best burger, the greatest sushi, or that perfect apartment. You just have to know where to look!"   Outside of his dedication to work, Kevin enjoys good food and plenty of exercise as the two work well together. He also sponsors a child in Kenya through a non-profit organization, and serves on the Board of Directors for his condominium's association, which gives him even greater insight into buildings and procedures.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|kbrunnock@bellmarc.com|kev22agency|0||  /  /    |.000000000|.000000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(201)410-5422|0|4.00000000|||||0||Kevin Brunnock|10401229578|01/29/2015 03:34:43 PM||KEVINBRUNN|1.00000000|5872CDDF-FC17-458A-A0D7-50964D7C1DF1|

He studied art, illustration, art history, and product design, with a major in Interior Design. He has since worked as a practicing interior designer for over 20 years, working with some of the most acclaimed design firms in the field, with a first-class roster of clients from around the world. Working with high-profile clients requires a high degree of professionalism, and that is exactly what Franck has always provided and continues to offer today to his real estate clients. In 2004, Franck established his own design firm, based on the driving principle that "everyone, regardless of means, deserves a beautiful home." As such, he makes sure to help the client establish an affordable budget, and has managed to work wonders on modest projects from the smallest New York City studio apartments to luxury midtown penthouses. Soon after, Franck branched out into television bringing his unique vision of interior design to viewers of ABC TV's "The View" as the on-air design expert, providing advice and home makeovers to lucky viewers from around the country. It was a natural progression from Interior Design to the world of Real Estate for him: the two tend to go hand in hand. Helping clients navigate through the home selection process, and further assisting them to envision the property's design potential are what drives him to do what he loves every day. Franck has been a resident of western Queens since 1996, in various neighborhoods such as Elmhurst and Woodside, before finally settling in Long Island City. With his thorough knowledge of the neighborhood and city overall, and years of experience working with a range of clients, Franck brings a superior level of knowledge, service and excellence to Bellmarc Really.|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|fhodelin@bellmarc.com|piperdog1|0||  /  /    |.000000000|.000000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(347)581-1295|1|4.00000000|||||0||Frank Hodelin|10401242646|01/29/2015 03:34:43 PM|59892|FRANKHODEL|1.00000000|4839A956-AD5A-4343-B399-F20DC3AB2A7E|

He prefers to treat his clients as new friends, offering a down-to-earth working relationship.  A native New Yorker, clients get the kind of real advice that can only come from someone who has spent their life here. Kyle loves the diversity, the history, the architecture that only a place like New York can offer every day.  Kyle believes that a good agent not only offers first rate customer service by listening to what the customer wants, but he is also a strong believer in good follow-up. He will not waste his client's time, since in this city especially, time is frequently their most valuable asset. His experience, combined with his charisma, his life-long exposure to the inventory,  and his skill in closing the deal make him what can unfortunately be a rarity in the city: a respectable agent that goes above and beyond to bring his clients results.  Kyle's work experience prior to real estate sales includes both work as a manager in the Listings Department  and as a rentals agent in the city. He  has experience in credit management as well, and is Certified as a FICO Professional.  During his work at a credit repair firm he had the rare opportunity to develop an in-depth understanding of the best ways service a real estate client if/when it comes time to obtain a mortgage.  Before entering into real estate and credit management, Kyle worked for five years at a family owned pharmacy for that prided itself on customer service and friendly problem solving. Formally,  Kyle attended John Jay College of Criminal Justice where he studied Forensic Psychology.  When not busy with real estate, he enjoys going to museums; finding new restaurants to frequent; meeting new people; traveling to New England, Long Island and California; golfing; and cooking.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|0|kwolhers@bellmarc.com|9147742805|0||  /  /    |.000000000|.000000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(914)774-2805|0|4.00000000|||||0|kwolhers@gmail.com|Kyle Wolhers|10401240698|01/29/2015 03:34:43 PM|59248|KYLEWOLHER|1.00000000||

It's a characteristic her customers really appreciate as she always finds the apartment of their dreams.  Add to that a litany of personality traits that run the gamut from all-out optimism to a great sense of humor, a friendly demeanor and a positive outlook and Galina is a decidedly determined sales agent who's always a pleasure to work with.  To put it succinctly, sales is in her blood.  Prior to entering real estate Galina was employed as a successful sales person in the field of fashion and event marketing.  She chose to make the transition to real estate and utilize her skills in a varied venue.  Today, Galina's goal is to gain a buyer's trust in her while earning a seller's confidence.  On a personal note, Galina is bi-lingual and was born in St. Petersburg, Russia.  She emigrated to the Big Apple 13 years ago and currently resides on the Upper West Side with her artist husband.  She is an avid animal lover, making her home with two loving felines. Hobbies and special interests include love of animals and nature, philosophy, biking and rollerblading. On the education front, she holds an Associate Degree from Leningrad Pharmaceutical College.  Testimonials  I am writing this letter in support of Mrs. Galina Prunier, who helped me purchase my new apartment in Murray Hill last year. I met Galina in October 2012, by mid-December I was already owner of my dream home. Galina is reliable; she possesses exceptional commitment and expertise.       -- Maria Zaroui  Galina was simply wonderful. She was more than a broker, she was actually a life saver. I'm originally from Brazil and I was really scared to start looking for apartments in New York, since it can be tricky to search for apartments in another city, and for me it was actually another country. I found Galina through the Naked Aparments website and she couldn't have been more attentive.  I spent one week in New York to find a place and she dedicated her entire time to me. She was dedicated, patient, ready to answer all my questions, and very helpful - more than I could have asked for - even with things like assisting me with making a wire transfer for the apartment. Galina is probably one of the kindest and most professional persons I have ever met. I am really thankful that I wrote her, and anybody who has her as a broker will be more than lucky.      -- Mariana|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|gprunier@bellmarc.com|maxim2006|0||  /  /    |.000000000|.000000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)232-4870|1|4.00000000|||||0||Galina Prunier|10401241460|03/08/2016 11:53:56 AM|60763||1.00000000|FE26BADB-2D0C-4726-952D-E61E3BE25987|

Born with a great sense of humor, Matthew always brings this to any given situation ,"One's appearance  and buying a home are 2 of the most personal stressful areas of our lives", humor makes the process not only more enjoyable, but releases tension and makes it easier to see things from a different perspective.   Matthew  prides himself in his learned ability to "crisis problem solving" that can arise in a most high pressure situations. Managing and facilitating either dialogue, situations that have deadlines, or any potential obstacles are a natural part of the process of dealing in either real estate or any other area.

A genuine people person, Matthew considers himself to be outgoing, playful and kind.  All in all, just the type of sales agent clients appreciate for the biggest purchase of their lives.  Matthew is a graduate of Pratt Institute with a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree. Born and raised in the Big Apple, he has always been fascinated by its neighborhoods and buildings.

My re-emergence in the New York City market, where I originally began my career renting & selling apartments in 1989 is a testament to my commitment to both the city and Real Estate.  "I love New York, where anything is possible. What inspires me about life is you never know what will happen until you take an action. Move, do something. See where that takes you and what comes from being there. I'm naturally curious about how things tick and how we affect events. Many of my clients have become great friends.  What sets me apart me from other realtors is my ability to listen well, combined with my enthusiasm for sharing. I can assist buyers and sellers while guiding them through the myriad of options specific to each situation. My dedication to the process and my capacity to articulate objectively the possible options keeps communication clear, and organized with an eye on the big picture. My astute insight into current trends, combined with my detective-like ability to research all details of every particular deal could make me an essential component to your buying or selling process.  I have an entrepreneurial approach to real estate that has earned me a diverse and devoted following. If you are selling, I can help you get the highest price for you current property, or if you are buying assist you in finding the best investment for your particular needs.     In addition to my Real Estate endeavors I publish TheaterLife.com (for theater buffs in NYC & the Hamptons), which keeps me active on the NYC/Hamptons social circuit along with my support of diverse fund raising activities that encompass the theatre, and numerous causes which champion the environment, human rights, health and education.

And because Ron fully comprehends exactly what it means to be a homeowner he can share that first-person knowledge with each and every client.     You could never call Ron a "pushy" salesperson.  Quite to the contrary, he's a teacher through and through believing his role to be that of an educator.  He likes to provide all pertinent information about a property and then allow the client to form their own conclusions.  He possesses a professional demeanor that is always calming and even-mannered, yet deliberate and detail-oriented.  His management style is well-suited to the fast-paced New York real estate market where he is well-versed in the art of the deal.   Ron's New York roots run deep.  As a third generation New Yorker, he has primarily called the neighborhoods of Chelsea and the West Village home.  Ron studied at the School of Visual Arts (SVA) in the Bachelor of Fine Arts program majoring in Advertising and Graphic Arts.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|rstabiner@bellmarc.com|rstab122936|0||  /  /    |.000000000|.000000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(516)359-2930|1|4.00000000|(212)727-0579||||0||Ronald Stabiner|10401245935|01/29/2015 03:34:43 PM|60974||1.00000000|C06FE0B0-7429-413C-B8A1-C2395A374DC5|

Today, real estate sales occupy Ed's time and his heart.  "I love real estate. It's in my blood," says Ed.  For Ed, when it comes to deal-making, his motto is satisfaction guaranteed.

Before making her mark in real estate at Bellmarc, she was the proud proprietor of a woman's accessory company.  Today, Allison enjoys working with clients buying and selling homes on New York's Upper East Side.  It's a neighborhood she knows inside out having grown up there.   She loves to view properties and takes a special interest in listening to client's issues and needs.  "If I didn't become a broker, I would have become a psychologist!" says Allison.  But real estate runs in Allison's family.  Both her mother and brother are in the business.  The temptation to follow suit was enticing and Allison had always wanted to be a part of the exciting New York real estate scene.  With her vast knowledge of the Upper East Side, Allison is in her element advising client's on its many benefits.  She also utilizes her own personal expertise in buying and selling when she works with her clients - understanding the process through their eyes.  Allison is an excellent listener who doesn't take herself too seriously.  She likes to make her client's feel comfortable and does her best to inject a dose of fun.

It was a path far more compatible with the demands of a growing family. While raising her four children and pursuing graduate work at Teachers College at Columbia University, she worked alongside passionate fundraisers and educators developing various programs for children in need. Eventually, Christine served on the Board of Directors for the Long Ridge School until her children moved on to middle school. Christine has a strong commitment to community, has trained as a hospice volunteer and started a family centered support group called Family Oxygen to help caregivers of individuals struggling with mental illness. It was this connection to community, her background in psychology and business along with the expected real estate obsession acquired by most homeowners that led her to a career in real estate after deciding to move back to her hometown here in New York City. She learned first hand, the process of moving can be full of emotional and financial challenges in a competitive urban environment, but according to Christine, with the right agent, it can be a rewarding and fiscally sound experience.   Christine is loyal to her city roots even after a decade-plus stint in the hinterlands of Bedford and northern Westchester.  While horse country may be beautiful, she knows there is nothing like the buzz of the city to make you feel alive. While others think raising children among throngs of people is crazy, Christine and her four children have embraced their urban life and appreciate the speed of the subway over miles of suburban roads, the seemingly infinite culinary choices delivered to your door in record time, and the beauty of a wonderfully ever changing city.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|cmoffatt@bellmarc.com|3girls1Boy|0||  /  /    |.000000000|.000000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)597-0979|0|4.00000000|||||0||Christine Moffatt|10401253837|01/29/2015 03:34:43 PM|||1.00000000|d5913e44-e4db-40ee-bdd3-8a4e436bf7d1|

He specializes in focusing on each client's individual needs, wishes and finances, and strives to provide an unmatched experience that is fun, fulfilling and financially beneficial.  A native New Yorker, Peter has a quick wit, creative eye, analytical mind and a good soul that truly enjoys helping others.

He will leave no stone unturned and use the requests and requirements of his clients as the barometer for finding THE apartment that matches the home of their dreams.  Here is a sample of what his clients have said :   "Apartment hunting in New York is definitely very complicated and we couldn't have done it without your help!"  "We are loving the new apartment and settling in great. I still can't believe we have such a great view!"    "Just wanted you to know how much we appreciate everything you've done for us!"  "Thank you so much for connecting us with Peter--we both agree that using a broker was 100% worth it."  Peter has lived in NYC all his life -- most of it in the Greenwich Village area.  He has been buying and selling apartments going back to when the Meat Packing District still sold meat, and the Bowery was less than cool.  After attending NYU, at both their undergrad and graduate business schools, Peter spent years as a marketing guru building many household brands like Bayer, Planters and Citi. He then spent nearly a decade marketing sports and played a key role in making the NBA a global brand. Peter is Internet savvy and an expert in social media.

In the years since then I've pursued my obsession until my husband and two children joke that I've seen every apartment on the West Side. But they don't know the worst: My obsession now extends to Harlem, Chelsea, and the new neighborhoods of the Far West 30s and 40s.  But you want to work with me not just because I know the apartments that would make you happy.  I've lived in Manhattan for more than 30 years (and in Brooklyn before that). I went to college at Barnard. I've raised two kids in the city. And through a lifetime of friends I've lived through pretty much everything the city has to offer_or that it can throw at you. I know the New York public and private school experience_my two children went to Dalton. I've put in my miles looking for the best places to eat and to shop. I've lived with doormen and without; with light and sky and without; with good coop boards and (sigh) without. I'm aware of all the trade offs and little things that make the difference between a great apartment and a bad apartment.  I'll take the time to get to know you and to help you understand what's important to you (and what trade-offs are possible and what are deal killers_for you).  As someone who has renovated more than one apartment in the city, I can help you visualize the potential that you can bring out in any apartment_and I can call on the expertise of friends in architecture and contracting to see how to achieve your dream (and to figure out what it would cost).|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|mdamico@bellmarc.com|Luna2001|0||  /  /    |.000000000|.000000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)334-6375|1|4.00000000|||||0|mariedamico515@gmail.com|Marie D'Amico|10401255666|01/29/2015 03:34:43 PM|||1.00000000|6405E870-63D3-4B70-8529-96910CD33DF2|

She never tires of meeting new people and searching for just the right property for a client.  Patricia has been negotiating real estate transactions for nearly 15 years and has a well-rounded background in home resale, new construction, NYS second-home markets and property management. Along with working the mid-town Manhattan market, Patricia is also focusing on the up and coming markets throughout the city.   Although Patricia is well-versed in high end sales, she says she will always enjoy working with those in the entry and mid-level markets too.  Her mantra is the same for all of her clients:  The client is number one.  In today's hurry-up world, a cornerstone of Patricia's real estate practice is patience.  Time and attention are gifts she gives freely - listening while clients share their dreams and goals, then answering their questions and helping them explore their options without pressure.  Clients often remark on her patience - both in helping them understand the entire process and in finding their perfect home.  To ensure a successful experience, Patricia utilizes her talent for guiding people through unfamiliar processes; as well as her skill and experience in understanding and explaining contracts, negotiating, working with banks and attorneys, and remaining calm under pressure.  When transactions run into "bumps in the road," she works it through, keeping everyone on an even keel and moving forward.  Real estate is a relationship-based business, and Patricia strives to create client relationships built on trust and confidence.  Her ultimate goal: a business built entirely upon referrals from clients who are completely satisfied with the professional and caring service they received.    When not serving clients, Patricia enjoys attending cultural events, reading, classic movies, power walking, and looking up to take photos of the amazing architecture all around the City.  As a REALTORr Patricia says she is fortunate in being able to work with clients who are enjoying life to the fullest, and she works hard to further that enjoyment by making their real estate purchases a pleasure.  They agree that she does just that.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|pbeattie@bellmarc.com|BellaMia14|0||  /  /    |.000000000|.000000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)599-7888|1|4.00000000|||||0||Patricia A.

As your advocate in the Manhattan real estate market, Anthony brings the skills he honed in his career as an engagement manager and consultant to Fortune 100 clients in insurance, finance, telecommunications and media. He is a retired member of the U.S. Army Reserves and has led mission-critical defense industry initiatives for the U.S. Navy.  Anthony's years as a consultant have taught him to be an attentive listener. He takes the time to really understand his clients' requirements and puts his considerable skills as a negotiator to work in service of their search for the perfect New York City haven.   His work with global corporations has also given him an understanding of cross-cultural dynamics, and he frequently works with international clients who are looking for a base in Manhattan. Anthony is licensed in both New York and New Jersey and is a knowledgeable resource for clients who are making a move across the Hudson, whether for career or leisure.  Recent clients wrote to express their appreciation for Anthony's superior customer service:  "From beginning to end you were there to calm our fears, to answer all our questions, to make sure all persons involved were functioning in our best interest, to give us inspiration and motivation for a new beginning and assurance that purchase and sale would go forward without difficulty. 'Thank you' just doesn't say enough. We are deeply grateful and indebted to you for all you did for us. You are very special!"  Anthony is a New Jersey native who fell in love with New York City during the years he and his wife have lived and worked in Manhattan. When he is not working on behalf of his clients, you may find him behind the wheel of the 1930 Ford Model A he restored from the ground up. He frequently drives in parades, so be sure to wave if you see him drive by - just look for the antique car with the rumble seat!|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|acavallaro@bellmarc.com|AjC072447|0||  /  /    |.000000000|.000000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(609)468-0917|0|4.00000000|||||0||Anthony Cavallaro|10401254578|01/29/2015 03:34:43 PM|63683||1.00000000|56994a6b-ee75-4044-b556-3b56dc83478f|

I've sold real estate to clients looking to buy rental property; purchase their first single family home; to multi-residential home owners looking for exclusive condominiums in the Rittenhouse or The Residence at the Ritz-Carlton; and to families looking to relocate to Union Square, Central Park and burgeoning Harlem.  I have also placed diplomats working for the United Nations in Co-op (rentals).  With respect to investors, through my efforts, national clients have secured ownership of rental units.  Multi-family developments, and industrial properties.  These multi-million dollar investment projects required in some cases understanding regulations associated with legislation.  I often orchestrate collaborations between legal counsel, financial institutions and land development experts to complete the investment purchase.   My clients can expect me to deliver my professional best and remain relevant.  I do so by holding several certifications: EcoBroker, Updated Ethics and Fair Housing, Brookfield Global Relocation Services and Senior/Baby Boomers.

She remains a caring, calming presence while getting deals done.    Janis's passion for real estate began in college. Unable to find a rental with two large dogs, she purchased the first of many homes and made a profit upon graduation.  After extensive travel and living abroad, Janis settled on the Upper West Side, for a time making her home in a houseboat at the 79th Street Boat Basin. Her enthusiasm for this part of the city is contagious. "As a parent, the UWS has offered so much in terms of quality of life -- great schools, two beautiful parks, excellent restaurants and shopping, but most importantly, a true sense of community."  A graduate of SUNY at Binghamton, Janis holds a BS in psychology and an MS in Computer Science.  Both of these areas of study continue to serve her well.  Her empathy, joy and ability to partner with clients eases process of finding or selling a home.  Janis is a member of FCC (Families with Children from China), volunteers for NAMI (National Alliance for the Mentally Ill), is a supporter of www.PoweringPotential.com (a non-profit that seeds grass-roots efforts to bring technology and solar power to schools in  remote areas), and is certified to teach Awareness Through Movement and Functional Integration (Feldenkrais Method).

She hopes to impart some of this enthusiasm and knowledge to her clientele as she translates their home vision into a reality.   Ellen has a backround as an educator in New York City public schools and earned her entrepreneurial chops having owned a business as a purveyor to small groceries & delis in the city.   Ellen is a native Long Islander who settled in upper Manhattan 22 years ago in Hudson Heights-which affords myriad opportunities to indulge her interests in history, architecture and design...."My neighborhood harbors many Revolutionary War remnants and sites as well as the magnificent Cloisters Museum in nearby Fort Tryon Park. The breathtaking natural scenery, which includes the Jersey palisades, Hudson River and the majestic George Washington Bridge, is unequaled anywhere in Manhattan. What makes it ideal for the people living here is that it's in close enough proximity to the cultural and entertainment hubs of the city yet far enough removed to afford a more peaceful, less congested lifestyle-along with a charming and palpable sense of community."   Ellen devotes much of her spare time to animal rescue and advocacy and also tutors elementary aged students. Exploring the underbelly and the unusually macabre aspects of the city are of particular interest to her.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|esiniscalchi@bellmarc.com|Mickisin1|0||  /  /    |50.0000000|50.0000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)855-8914|1|4.00000000|||||0||Ellen Siniscalchi|10401232528|02/10/2016 10:54:51 AM|65734||1.00000000|3daca406-882a-4a76-aa75-c5466dc4ec8b|

He subsequently had a long and varied musical career that spanned the classical world of music to Broadway.  His interest in real estate, which eventually became his avocation and vocation, began 25 years ago when he purchased his apartment in the delightful northern Manhattan neighborhood of Hudson Heights. While continuing his chosen profession, the enthusiasm for real estate escalated - he loved nothing more than talking to people about how to find an apartment, whether one should buy or rent, the various types of mortgages that exist and how to get one, the differences between coops and condos, the divergent neighborhoods of Manhattan.  It was a natural transition to the world of the real estate professional, first as a private investor, and then as a sales agent who would help someone find their home. He finds nothing more gratifying than assisting someone in that search of one's own little castle.  As an agent with Coldwell Banker Bellmarc Simone Song, Richard takes great pride in being a good listener, understanding a person's needs and trying to present all relevant options. He understands that in purchasing a home it is probably the biggest and financially most important decision they might ever make, and that it is not something one takes lightly. He will be there to help and guide you through all the various steps; finding the right apartment, the negotiating process, finding an attorney if need be, talking about financing options, and in coop situations, helping with the Board approval process.  For the person looking to sell their apartment Richard understands the importance of present day market conditions, doing comparative market studies, and advising on an appropriate selling price. Besides being a very hands-on agent, he uses the most up-to-date internet aids that will give your apartment the greatest visibility and exposure.   Beyond loving to talk about real estate and music he shares his life with his wife, Linda, their house on Long Island, and grandchildren, Sadie and Lucas, who live too far away in Ithaca.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|rwasley@bellmarc.com|LINDARD1944|0||  /  /    |.000000000|.000000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(718)404-6810|1|4.00000000|||||0|rhwasley@gmail.com|Richard Wasley|10301206427|08/31/2015 06:34:16 AM|65131||2.00000000|968c4fd8-5427-4215-b1d5-621cbf34e2fb|

Over the course of her first two years, she has accomplished several closings, including residential sales, rentals and commercial leasing, which she attests to her dedication, understanding of Manhattan communities, and extensive corporate foundation - a combination proven to effectively move the sales process along for her clients.  Prior to joining Coldwell Banker Bellmarc Simone Song, Gretchen worked for a high-end retail company, managing all aspects of U.S./Global seasonal and promotional catalogue development and implementations, which she credits to further enriching her understanding of what truly are the critical elements of "business" - on a whole; being a valuable asset in work efficiency, time management, as well as effective interpersonal communication, organization and innovative problem solving.    Gretchen's corporate foundation, along with her ardent drive, natural creative spirit and attention to details, is reflected in the day-to-day work she puts forth as a Residential Agent, and what ultimately delivers for clients.   When Gretchen is not an Agent full swing, you can find her pursuing creative projects such as sewing, painting or refinishing a piece of furniture.  Traveling, visiting museums, leisure afternoons at the flea market, and spending time with family and friends are the undeniable extras rooted in her purpose and balance.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|gdechellis@bellmarc.com||0||  /  /    |.000000000|.000000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)484-3315|0|4.00000000|||||0||Gretchen DeChellis|10401231170|01/29/2015 03:34:43 PM|65134||1.00000000|203D2B1C-81CF-409E-9398-1793FEF13E2F|

In this time she has worked with many repeat sellers and buyers, who return to her looking to upgrade and expand, downsize and economize, or simply make a lateral move.  Laura enjoys working with new buyers and sellers, too - carefully and systematically guiding them through the landscape of New York real estate, clearly explaining every part of the process.  She believes that experience and clarity are key to ensure that the process of buying or selling is smooth.  Through her many listings and sales, Laura intimately knows the co-ops and condos in her area of specialty - Hudson Heights/Washington Heights - where she has lived and owned for 18 years.   Laura believes that volunteering in the community is important to being a member of that community.  Working with the board of her current building she helped bring a 50 kwh array of solar panels to the building making it one of the first private co-ops in New York to convert to solar thus  lowering the co-op's carbon foot print for years to come.    Laura is a produced, published, and nationally award winning playwright.   She is also a former dancer and choreographer who studied with Martha Graham and choreographed works that appeared throughout the east coast.  She also directed the design of an extensive Risk Management Quality Assurance database for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America where she worked for several years.    With a B.A. in Urban Studies, Laura has watched New York meet the social challenges and shifting economies of the last 40 years, to become the prosperous, world class city it is today.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|lhembree@bellmarc.com||0||  /  /    |75.0000000|55.0000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)306-9280|1|4.00000000|||||0||Laura Hembree|40HE1074920|01/29/2015 03:34:43 PM|65137||1.00000000|f6647271-62d6-4b85-877c-897f4a03065a|

While she grew up in the Boston area, and lived in Chicago, it wasn't until she made a conscious decision to move to New York over 20 years ago did she feel she was actually home.  She is excited to share her knowledge and insight with those who desire to call this magical city their home too - whether that's a family considering a move to the city or a recent college grad (like her son).  Prior to Real Estate, Lyn marketed some of the world's most recognizable brands. She began her career in packaged goods after earning her MBA from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern. She soon moved into the more exciting world of entertainment, where she honed her skills as a marketing executive for CBS, CNBC and Discovery, among others.  Lyn's intuitive and analytical understanding of consumer wants and buyer needs are a perfect match for the ever-evolving real estate market in New York City.   Friends and colleagues would describe Lyn as resourceful, tenacious, and fun.  Having raised a son here on her own, Lyn knows the parks, the schools, where to get the best haircuts, and how to negotiate the best deals.

In the early 1990s Richard moved into residential mortgage lending.  This experience helps enormously today in understanding not only the current rate environment, but what type of loan, if any, is the best financial decision for his clients.  He has closed, literally, hundreds of purchase money transactions.  His professional approach is to consider all the participants in the transaction important, while endeavoring to bring satisfaction and  discretion to everyone involved.  This has resulted in many satisfied, repeat customers.  Richard has also been a real estate investor that at one time owned over fifteen properties.  Most recently, prior to joining Bellmarc, he worked with the largest independent realtor on the East End and North Fork of Long Island, helping his clients buy, sell, and rent their homes in the city and at the shore.  A life-long athlete, Rich enjoys staying fit by swimming and working out.  He is the proud father of three great, grown kids, and two beautiful granddaughters.  With his high energy commitment to clients and knowledge of current market trends Richard relishes helping a seller market a property to gain maximum exposure and the highest sales price, and working with buyers to find their perfect home.|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|rmulholland@bellmarc.com|yankees28|0||  /  /    |.000000000|.000000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)207-4446|0|4.00000000|||||0||Richard Mulholland|10401247340|01/29/2015 03:34:43 PM|65322||1.00000000|81bff678-b6db-43a4-81bb-a2148e1b0d06|

The jump from retail to real estate was not difficult. "There are a lot of similarities between the two. Both are about developing relationships with customers and providing great customer service, and require a desire to go above and beyond to find that perfect item or apartment for your client," she says. Her background in business, her ability to listen to customers and ascertain what they need, combined with a good sense of humor are invaluable tools in the Manhattan real estate market.  A Manhattan resident for over 30 years, Anne knows the city very well.  Anne has lived with her family on the Upper West Side since 1992. She is very knowledgeable about her neighborhood and familiar with schools - both public and private, K-12 - children's after-school classes and sports leagues, all are which important to buyers and sellers that have families.  Anne has a wide range of interests, including travel, reading and sports, both professional and collegiate.  She loves discovering new restaurants, shops and other hidden gems. She can also frequently be found in Riverside Park with her two rambunctious rescue dogs.

As a young child, Kumiko was transfixed by a landscaped park showcasing model houses near her home. To her, it was a magical park filled with fairy tale houses. She was educated by the passion, love and care the architects put in to that project and she developed a keen eye to discern the real beauty a home can possess. Today, seeing great homes reminds her of those days and makes her feel happy and honored to help those achieve their real estate dreams.  Coming from the worlds of Japanese real estate and then banking, Kumiko is an international professional with a New York sensibility. She is hard working and driven to achieve her clients' goals. For Kumiko, the tougher the challenge, the happier and more charged she feels. And yet there is no nicer person to work with. She strives to make the transaction process as fast, fair and pleasant as possible for everyone involved.  Living in Manhattan for 16 years, and having covered not only Manhattan but also Queens and Brooklyn in her eight years in the business, she has a solid understanding of the New York City real estate market and the challenges presented to anyone looking to sell, buy or rent. She uses her extensive knowledge to locate the right apartment at the lowest cost for my customers, and offer support whenever they need it, even after they have moved in. For sellers, she is a great resource for a wealth of information and possesses superb marketing skills.  Kumiko is a proactive agent who believes in open and frequent communication. She knows that communication is the key to making satisfactory transactions happen. No matter how experienced her client, she creates a partnership where everyone is kept in the loop.  Kumiko was born and raised in Tokyo, where she worked in retail banking and as a financial advisor to individuals. She also fulfilled a dream of working in residential real estate. Kumiko moved to New York in 1999, and has lived on the Upper East Side ever since. She is a Magna Cum Laude graduate of Hunter College, with a BA in English Literature. In her spare time, she enjoys handcrafting, hiking and baking - in fact, Kumiko is a real cake lover, and has the special skill of gobbling up a whole 6-inch cake in 1 hour!    An animal lover, she has a special affinity for cats, and lives with several fun loving felines. Before she came to the U.S., Kumiko she was a show cat breeder of Somalis and Himalayans. If you have questions about cats, please feel free to ask her!|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|kspencer@bellmarc.com|peepopaapo|0||  /  /    |.000000000|.000000000|0|0|0|3.00000000|  /  /    |(917)837-6171|0|4.00000000|||||0||Kumiko Spencer|40SP1152034|02/29/2016 03:35:30 PM|||1.00000000||
